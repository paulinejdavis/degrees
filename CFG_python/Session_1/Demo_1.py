Show students how to create a new file and then run this file.
Explain where the result is displayed (console) and then point how to re-run the file if necessary.

### EXERCISE 1 ###
"""
Exercise 1.1: Now that you've run your first program, try the following:

- Change the message to anything you want
- Repeat the code on multiple lines to output several messages
- Find out what happens when you remove different parts of the code (e.g. brackets)
- Don't worry if something unexpected happens. Think about what you changed and why it might have caused it to happen.
"""

### DEMO & EXERCISE 2 ###
"""
Ask students to use Python console in PyCharm and practice the following operations together. 
Explain where required.

5 - 6
8 * 9
6 / 2
5 / 0
5.0 / 2
5 % 2
2 * (10 + 3)
2 ** 4

What does each one do and what is its output?

Are there any outputs you didn't expect?

"""

### DEMO & EXERCISE 3 ###
"""
In your Python console type each of these

"Cat"
"Cat" + " videos"

"Cat" * 3
"Cat" + 3

"Cat".upper()
"Cat".lower()

"the lord of the rings".title()

What is the output for each one and why?
One of them causes an exception. Read the exception message. What do you think it means?

### DEMO & EXERCISE 4 ###

EXAMPLES OF STRINGS METHODS

You can copy-paste these examples into your console to save tim typing. 
Demonstrate what they do and only then complete an exercise together.

# 'Our example string object'.endswith('mock')
# 'To make a nice cuppa you need: tea, milk, sugar and a cookie '.split(',')
# 'Our example string object'.replace('p', '#')

DEMO - show in PyCharm console how to type a string, use dot and a 'tab' to bring up a list of methods for an object. 

# TASK TO COMPLETE TOGETHER: check built in methods available to use for strings

'string object' + . + click TAB

### EXERCISE 5 ###

"""
Errors and casting objects into different types

Run this:

print("Cat" + 3)

it would result in Error!
Putting a number in str() converts it to a string

print("Cat" + str(3))

The oranges variable is reused twice in the program
"""

### EXERCISE 7 ###
"""
In a new Python file called cat_food.py, create a program that calculates
how many cans of cat food you need to feed 10 cats.

Your will need:

A variable for the number of cats
A variable for the number of cans each cat eats in a day
A print() function to output the result
Extension: change the calculation to work out the amount needed for 7 days

Example solution below (share it with students after they have had a go)
"""
# cats = 10
# cans = 2
#
# total_cans = cats * cans
#
# output = str(cats) + " cats eat " + str(total_cans) + " cans"
# print(output)

### EXERCISE 7 ###
"""
Rewrite cat_food.py to use string formatting instead of joining strings with +.

An example of string formatting:
--------------------------------

user_name = 'Jenny_1995'
age = 23

output = '{} is {} years old'.format(user_name, age)
print(output)

# Example solution

### DEMO 8 ###
"""
Show few examples on how to join strings together:

'-'.join(my_words)
' '.join(my_words)
''.join(my_words)

"""

### EXERCISE 8 ###
"""
Perform string formatting, so that your final sentence looks like this:
guests = ["Mary", "Pete", "Eoin"]

Result:
"We are going to cinema with my classmates: Mary, Pete, Eoin and me"

Example solution below:
(We can use string interpolation and join() function to build this sentence)
"""

# guests = ["Mary", "Pete", "Eoin"]
#
# "We are going to cinema with my classmates: {names} and me.".format(
#     names=', '.join(guests))


### DEMO & EXERCISE 9 ###
"""
String Slicing ( do these examples with students explaining every case)

S = 'ABCDEFGHI'
print(S[2:7])

S = 'Hippopotamus'
print(S[-7:-2])

S = 'ABCDEFGHI'
print(S[2:-5])

S = 'ABCDEFGHI'
print(S[2:7:2])

Slice at Beginning & End

Omitting the start index starts the slice from the index. Meaning, S[:stop] is equivalent to S[0:stop]
Omitting the stop index extends the slice to the end of the string. Meaning, S[start:] is equivalent to S[start:len(S)]

# Slice first three characters from the string
S = 'ABCDEFGHI'
print(S[:3]) 

# Slice last three characters from the string
S = 'ABCDEFGHI'
print(S[6:])

Reverse a String
You can reverse a string by omitting both start and stop indices and specifying a step as -1.

S = 'ABCDEFGHI'
print(S[::-1])

S = 'Code First Girls'
print(S[::-1])
